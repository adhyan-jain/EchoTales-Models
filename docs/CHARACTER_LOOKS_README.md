# Character Look Generation Feature

This project now includes **automatic character look generation** that creates detailed physical descriptions for characters based on their personality traits, gender, and age group.

## üé≠ How It Works

When you run the character processing scripts, they will automatically generate comprehensive physical descriptions including:

- **Physical Description**: A detailed narrative description of the character's overall appearance
- **Height**: Appropriate height ranges based on gender and age
- **Build**: Body type influenced by personality traits (e.g., high extraversion ‚Üí more athletic build)
- **Hair**: Color and style based on age and personality (e.g., elderly ‚Üí gray hair, high openness ‚Üí unique colors)
- **Eyes**: Randomly selected eye color
- **Skin**: Various skin tone options
- **Distinctive Features**: Features that reflect personality (e.g., "kind eyes" for high agreeableness)
- **Clothing Style**: Dress style based on personality (e.g., high conscientiousness ‚Üí professional attire)

## üß† Personality-Based Generation

The system uses the Big Five personality traits (OCEAN) to influence appearance:

### Openness (Creativity/Imagination)
- **High (>0.7)**: Artistic clothing, creative fashion, unique hair colors, expressive features
- **Low**: Traditional styles, common hair colors, practical appearance

### Conscientiousness (Organization/Discipline)
- **High (>0.7)**: Well-groomed appearance, professional attire, neat presentation, fit/toned build
- **Low**: More casual, relaxed styling

### Extraversion (Social Energy)
- **High (>0.7)**: Athletic/strong build, bold fashion, confident posture, engaging features
- **Low (<0.4)**: Slender/lean build, understated style, quieter presence

### Agreeableness (Cooperation/Kindness)
- **High (>0.7)**: Kind eyes, warm expression, approachable style, soft colors
- **Low**: More neutral features and styling

### Neuroticism (Emotional Instability)
- **High (>0.7)**: Intense gaze, expressive features, dynamic energy, tense/wiry build
- **Low**: Calm, stable features
