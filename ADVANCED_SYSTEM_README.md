# üöÄ Advanced Character Processing System for Novel Analysis

A sophisticated character processing system that takes BookNLP output and dramatically improves character identification, dialogue attribution, and personality analysis.

## üéØ Core Problems Solved

### 1. **Pronoun Characters** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Pronouns (he, she, they, I, you, etc.) were treated as separate characters
- **Solution**: Advanced filtering system removes pronouns and reassigns their quotes to actual named characters
- **Implementation**: Pattern-based filtering with context analysis

### 2. **Misattributed Quotes** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Quotes assigned to wrong characters or narrator text assigned to characters
- **Solution**: Sophisticated quote attribution analysis using dialogue tags, context, and confidence scoring
- **Implementation**: Multi-factor analysis with confidence thresholds

### 3. **Character Merging** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Multiple instances of same character (e.g., "Klein", "Klein Moretti")
- **Solution**: Fuzzy matching and similarity analysis to merge character instances
- **Implementation**: SequenceMatcher with configurable similarity thresholds

### 4. **Quote Attribution** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Incorrect identification of who is actually speaking vs who is being mentioned
- **Solution**: Context-aware analysis distinguishing dialogue from narrator descriptions
- **Implementation**: Dialogue tag detection, quote structure analysis, and proximity-based assignment

### 5. **Personality Analysis** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Default 0.5 values instead of actual personality analysis
- **Solution**: Pre-trained BERT models + enhanced pattern matching fallback
- **Implementation**: Minej/bert-base-personality model with OCEAN trait mapping

### 6. **Gender Classification** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Inaccurate gender classification
- **Solution**: Multi-method approach using offline models and context analysis
- **Implementation**: gender-guesser + pronoun analysis + title analysis

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_data(booknlp_output):
    """
    - Load BookNLP character data
    - Extract chapter boundaries using [CHAPTER_START_{number}] markers
    - Build character mention mapping
    - Extract all text tokens with character associations
    """
```

### Phase 2: Character Consolidation
```python
def consolidate_characters(characters):
    """
    - Identify characters with same/similar names using fuzzy matching
    - Merge character instances (combine mentions, quotes, context)
    - Remove pronoun-based characters (he, she, I, you, they, etc.)
    - Filter out non-character entities and chapter markers
    """
```

### Phase 3: Quote Attribution Analysis
```python
def fix_quote_attribution(text_tokens, characters):
    """
    Core logic for proper quote attribution:
    
    1. Parse dialogue structure:
       - Find text within quotation marks
       - Identify dialogue tags ("said", "asked", "replied", etc.)
       - Track speaker transitions
    
    2. Context analysis:
       - Look for speaker indicators before/after quotes
       - Use narrative context to identify speakers
       - Handle reported speech vs direct speech
    
    3. Narrator speech detection:
       - Identify when narrator mentions character but isn't quoting them
       - Track narrative descriptions vs dialogue
       - Create separate category for narrator observations about characters
    
    4. Proximity-based assignment (as fallback):
       - Assign quotes to nearest named character
       - Avoid assigning to characters only mentioned in passing
    """
```

### Phase 4: Character Classification

#### Gender Classification
```python
def classify_gender_advanced(character_name, context_samples, quotes):
    """
    Multi-method approach using offline models:
    1. gender-guesser library (name-based classification)
    2. Pronoun analysis in context
    3. Title analysis (Mr., Mrs., Miss, etc.)
    """
```

#### Personality Analysis
```python
def analyze_personality_with_models(character_quotes, context):
    """
    Use available personality detection models:
    1. Minej/bert-base-personality (Hugging Face)
    2. Custom BERT fine-tuning if needed
    3. Enhanced pattern matching fallback
    """
```
